Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Timing:3224 - The clock ppuCLK associated with TIMEGRP "PPUBus" OFFSET = IN 10 ns VALID 10 ns BEFORE COMP "ppuCLK" does not clock
   any registered input components.
WARNING:Timing:3225 - Timing constraint TIMEGRP "PPUBus" OFFSET = IN 10 ns VALID 10 ns BEFORE COMP "ppuCLK" ignored during timing analysis
WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <picCLK> is placed at site <P45>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <picCLK_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y2>. There is only
   a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer, and
   they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists and
   correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <picCLK.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   8 block(s) optimized away
   1 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "theDisplayRam/N0" is sourceless and has been removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		ColorRAM/XST_GND
VCC 		ColorRAM/XST_VCC
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC
GND 		theDisplayRam/XST_GND
VCC 		theDisplayRam/XST_VCC
GND 		theOamRam/XST_GND
VCC 		theOamRam/XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
