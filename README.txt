Contained within is all the information you should need to build and program your very own Universal PPU.

Here are the brief programming instructions:
1. Load the microcontroller with the firmware.  You will need a Pickit or equivalent programmer to do this.
2. Load PaletteMaker.  Write out a palette file.
3. Connect the Universal PPU to your computer via a USB cable.
4. Load UniversalPpuConfig.  Connect to your Universal PPU.
5. Under the FPGA tab, load universalppu.bin (NOT universalppu.bit).  Write the FPGA.
6. Under the Palette tab, load your palette file.  Write it.

And that's it!  Good luck!
